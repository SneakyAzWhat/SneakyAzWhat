- 👋 Hi, I’m [@SneakyAzWhat](https://twitter.com/SneakyAzWhat)

- 👀 I’m interested in: C# stuff primarily :)

- 🌱 I’m currently learning: WPF for desktop applications (as I come up with project ideas), Unity3D and also wrapping my head around computer networking.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: I am not really a designer so someone who is into WPF and who likes designing/xaml could reach out for help on the programming side of things, I'd be willing to try new 'smaller scope' projects that are using C# as well.

- 📫 How to reach me: [twitter](https://twitter.com/SneakyAzWhat) (DMs are open), [discord](https://discord.gg/YjP2Js7W8K), [email](mailto:sneakyazwhat@gmail.com)
